I've been building a model to predict students' exam scores based on various factors. This involved:
📊 Loading and exploring the dataset to understand the data distribution and identify missing values. 🧹 Handling missing data through imputation. ⚙️ Preprocessing categorical features using Label Encoding. 🔍 Analyzing the correlation between different factors and exam scores. 📈 Visualizing relationships and identifying outliers. 🧼 Cleaning the data by removing outliers using the IQR method. 🔄 Splitting the data for training and testing. 🧠 Training and evaluating both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models. 🔧 Experimenting with different feature combinations (like adding 'Attendance' alongside 'Hours_Studied') to improve model performance. 📉 Analyzing learning curves to assess the models' performance with varying training set sizes.
